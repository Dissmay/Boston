			About <br>
				Boston Dynamics
		</h2>
		
		<p class="some__article_p">
			We began as a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where we developed the first robots that ran and maneuvered like animals. 
			Now we are taking the next step, combining the principles of dynamic control and balance with sophisticated mechanical designs, cutting-edge electronics, and software for perception, navigation, and intelligence. Boston Dynamics 
			has an extraordinary technical team of engineers and scientists who seamlessly combine advanced analytical thinking with bold engineering 
			and boots-in-the-mud practicality. <br> <br>
			We pride ourselves in building machines that both break boundaries 
			and work in the real world.
